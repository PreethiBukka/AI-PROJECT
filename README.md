# Diamond Price Prediction Model 
The model is build using Linear regresssion, KNN and Decison Tree Algorithms
Following are the brief steps followed in developing the machine learning models. They are as follows
1. Loading the dataset. 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis 
3. Data pre-processing 
4. Splitting the data into train and test splits 
5. Model training 
6. Hyper parameter tuning 
7. Model Evaluation 
8. Real time prediction
